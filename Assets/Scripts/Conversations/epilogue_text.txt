It’s taken all day, and you’ve journeyed far beyond your front door, but you’ve finally managed to gather the recipe cards that had been scattered across the land. You also managed to pick up some new utensils along the way! 

With your cookbook now full bursting with new ideas for delicious soups, you turn back towards home, where the gentle glow of the lamps radiates from the windows, filling your belly with warmth. Suddenly, a terrifying rumble shakes your whole body!

You glance down at your belly, angrily protesting and demanding you head inside at once to begin making one of the exciting soups stuffed among the pages of the tome. 

As you cross the threshold into your home, you smile to yourself as you glance around at all the new faces that have been added to your family. Though you’re right back where you started, you remind yourself that it’s not always about the destination, is it?
